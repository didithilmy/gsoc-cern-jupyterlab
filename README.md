# Making Exabytes of LHC data seamlessly accessible on Jupyter Notebooks
### Exercise for Candidate Students

This repository contains the source codes to do the exercise for the purpose of technical test of CERN-HSF Google Summer of Code 2020.

#### [Task 1](task1/)
In task 1, candidates are expected to write a program on Jupyter Notebook that generates 10 random files, and prints the names and md5 hashsum of the files.

#### [Task 2](task2/)
In task 2, candidates are expected to create a JupyterLab extension that displays weather information on the left sidebar of the JupyterLab interface.

#### [Task 3 (Optional)](task3/)
In task 3, candidates are expected to further develop the extension created in task 2 to make the weather JSON data accessible from the notebook's kernel.
